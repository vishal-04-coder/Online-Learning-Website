          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science, enabling efficient problem-solving and optimized software design. Data Structures are specialized ways to organize and store data to facilitate efficient operations such as retrieval, insertion, and deletion. Common examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. On the other hand, Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving specific computational problems, such as searching, sorting, and graph traversal. Together, they form the backbone of programming and software development.
            An array is a basic data structure where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. It provides constant-time access to elements using an index, but operations like insertion and deletion can be costly due to the need to shift elements. Arrays are suitable for scenarios where data size is fixed and frequent lookups are required. A more flexible structure is the linked list, where each element (node) contains data and a pointer to the next node. Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion, especially at the beginning or middle, but accessing elements requires traversal, making lookups slower compared to arrays.
            Other common data structures include stacks and queues, which operate on the principle of restricted access. A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue operates on First In, First Out (FIFO). These structures are widely used in applications like expression evaluation and task scheduling. Trees and graphs are more advanced structures that model hierarchical and networked data, respectively. Trees, particularly binary trees, are useful for searching and sorting operations, while graphs are essential for representing relationships in social networks, routing problems, and more.
            Efficient algorithms play a vital role in leveraging these data structures. For example, searching algorithms like linear search and binary search help locate elements, while sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort organize data. Advanced techniques like dynamic programming, divide and conquer, and greedy algorithms are used to solve complex problems with optimization.
            Understanding DSA is crucial for writing efficient code, optimizing resource usage, and solving real-world problems effectively. It forms the core of competitive programming, technical interviews, and advanced fields like machine learning and database management.</p>
