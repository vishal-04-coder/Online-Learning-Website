          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>What is DSP?
            Digital Signal Processing (DSP) involves the manipulation, analysis, and modification of signals using digital techniques. These signals are typically represented in digital form (discrete values) and processed to extract information, enhance quality, or prepare them for other applications.
            
            Importance of DSP
            Ubiquity: Found in modern devices like smartphones, TVs, medical equipment, and radar systems.
            Versatility: Enables applications in audio processing, image processing, communications, biomedical signal analysis, and more.
            Precision: Offers high accuracy and repeatability compared to analog signal processing.
            Key Concepts
            Signals: Functions representing physical phenomena, such as sound, light, or temperature, often as a function of time or space.
            
            Analog Signals: Continuous in time and amplitude.
            Digital Signals: Discrete in time and amplitude.
            Systems: Mathematical models that describe the operation on signals to produce an output.
            
            Examples: Filters, amplifiers, and modulators.
            Sampling: The process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal by taking periodic measurements.
            
            Nyquist Theorem: The sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency of the analog signal to avoid aliasing.
            Quantization: Approximating continuous amplitude values to discrete levels, which introduces quantization error.
            
            Basic Operations in DSP
            Convolution: Measures how the shape of one signal modifies another.
            Fourier Transform: Converts signals between time and frequency domains for analysis.
            Z-Transform: Extends Fourier Transform to complex signals for stability and control analysis.
            Filtering: Removes unwanted parts of a signal or extracts desired components.
            Applications of DSP
            Audio and Speech Processing: Noise reduction, echo cancellation, audio compression.
            Image Processing: Image enhancement, compression, and feature detection.
            Communication Systems: Modulation, demodulation, and error correction.
            Biomedical Engineering: ECG analysis, medical imaging, and prosthetic development.
            Radar and Sonar: Signal detection and target identification.</p>
